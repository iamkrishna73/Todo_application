# Todo_application

•	The application will allow a user to create new tasks, assign them a title and due date, and choose a project for that task to belong to.
•	It has a text based user interface via the command-line.
•	Once the user is using the application, he/she should be able to also edit, mark as done or remove tasks. They can also quit and save the current task list to file, and then restart the application with the former state restored.

The solution achieves the following requirements:
‣ Model a task with a task title, due date, status and project
‣ Display a collection of tasks that can be sorted both by date and project
‣ Support the ability to add, edit, mark as done, and remove tasks
‣ Support a text-based user interface

‣ Load and save task list to file![2023-06-03 (5)](https://github.com/iamkrishna73/Todo_application/assets/101132070/ee49883f-d8aa-4a41-87e1-4dc53a01b8f2)
